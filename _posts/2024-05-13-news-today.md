## Market mood
if month-over-month core CPI tops 0.4%, that would likely spur a selloff across all risk assets, with the S&P 500 falling between 1.75% to 2.5% as investors find shelter in commodity plays, Tyler says.

But if core CPI comes in between 0.3% and 0.35% from the prior month — near JPMorgan and consensus forecasts — the S&P 500’s outcome ranges from a 0.5% loss to a 1% gain, depending on whether rent inflation remains elevated, Tyler added. Any outcome where the core month-over-month declines sequentially will be “read as a positive by the market,” especially if the figure comes in below 0.2%, which may even revive bets for a June rate cut and send the S&P 500 higher by 2% to 2.5%, he added.
